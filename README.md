We've provided a minimal frontend for you to integrate with. 

## Running the frontend

You'll need Docker installed.

`docker compose up`

You can then access the frontend at [http://localhost:8501/]()

We've added some dummy data so you can see what the end result will look like.

## Adding your code

Your code should interface with the existing frontend via the `backend.py` module.

You are free to write whatever code you like (inside this service, or adding new ones). 

Feel free to expand upon the frontend if there are features that you feel are missing, or you want to change how state is handled.
